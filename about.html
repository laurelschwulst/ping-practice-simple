      <div class="large-text">
        Certain language clicks.  It resonates in our bodies, touches some invisible place within.
      </div>
  
        <p>
            Sometimes we encounter this language out in the world. Other times, we hear it in our minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Ping Practice universe, we call these bits of language “Pings”. <sup>1234</sup>
        </p>
<p>
        What – if anything – these “Pings” might mean and how we might use them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and evolves over time. 
    </p>
    <p>
The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how to work with them) unclear.
</p>
<p>
Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place. 
</p>
<p>
Ping Practice is a journaling <a href="method.html">method</a> and <a href="app.html">app</a> designed to help you synthesize these fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are inspired and equipped to embody.
</p>
<p>
The method emerged through years of experimentation orbiting a central question:
<b>How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense opportunities to do so?</b>
</p>
<p>
Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an expansive body of pre-existing thought and through conversations with <a href="people.html">people</a> who see making-meaning from what they experience as an act of survival.
