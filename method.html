        <h2>Ping</h2>
        <p>
            Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and insight. Let's call  these "Pings." [ii]
        </p>
        <p>
            A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name, lyric, quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
The most important thing about Pings – and what differentiates them from other thoughts – is that a Ping is language that moves you, "clicks," or otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
</p>
<p>
You are likely encountering a Ping if the movement or attraction you sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without thinking...as if what you are encountering touches something latent within you. 
</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

Ping Practice is a 6-step method.

<ol style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 1em;">
    <li>
        The first step is <b>Sense</b>.<br><br>
        <i>This means being aware and present so that you can notice things that "Ping" something within you.</i>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        The second step follows quickly after the first: <b>Name</b><br><br>
        <i>Translating – no matter how rough – what Pinged for you and holding this ping in the place where you've put all of the other pings you've logged before.</i><br><br>

        The most important thing in this moment is making sure the name you give to the Ping is specific enough for your future self to recall what you were referring to.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        The third step is to <b>Revisit</b> previous Pings. <br><br>
        <i>The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i><br><br>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Editing</u> Pings so the language you use to represent them better reflects what it was that you initially noticed.
            </li><br>
            <li><u>Responding</u> to Pings as a way of exploring all that a particular Ping could contain/bring up for you.
            </li><br>
            <li><u>Relating</u> Pings to one another to help identify and name patterns that could help to explain your resonance with a particular Ping or set of Pings.
            </li><br>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
